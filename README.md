# Python for Meteorology, Oceanography, and Climate

This workshop aims to introduce participants to the powerful Python programming language and its diverse applications in Earth Sciences, with a focus on meteorology, oceanography, and climate. 
Throughout the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to:
 - Explore Data Manipulation: Utilize Python to collect, clean, transform, and organize meteorological, oceanographic, and climate data.
 - Efficient Data Analysis: Employ the Pandas library to work with large datasets and perform statistical analyses.
 - Clear and Concise Data Visualization: Create custom graphs and maps using the Matplotlib library to communicate research findings effectively.
 - Perform Numerical Calculations: Use the NumPy library for complex mathematical operations and numerical simulations.

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
 - Write Python scripts to automate tasks and efficiently analyze data.
 - Visualize and interpret data.
 - Independently develop research and data analysis projects.

## Target Audience:

Undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and professionals in the fields of meteorology, oceanography, climate, and Earth sciences in general, who wish to enhance their programming and data analysis skills.

## Prerequisites:

1. Basic computer skills and an interest in learning programming.
2. Anaconda with the latest python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and jupyterlab 4.3.5 .

## Workshop Content:

1. Python Fundamentals:
	- Environment
